                    <p>As a former sales professional I achieved notable successes. I have always had an interest in communication and helping others. However, sales did not allow me reach to the number of people necessary to affect the positive change I would like to see. After some deliberation, I decided to find a different path that would allow me to actualize my deeper aspirations.
                    During my time at General Assembly ATL, I learned Front-End/Full Stack development tools that have allowed me to expand on the realm of what I thought was attainable with programming. I have gained a new and exciting skill set that will propel me into the next phase of my career as a value-creator</p>

            <p>Bus-boy was my first front end web app. Busboy is game about a first day hire at an Italian restaurant. For his first task he is told to bust the tables, and the first order of business is to get those dirty tablecloths off the table. Theres only one problem, the tables are coming so fast the theres almost no time to collect the sheets. Time for a little old fashioned cloth pulling, but be careful, pull too quick or too slow and the dirty dishes will fly right on to the floor</p>

            <p>Memer is an app created using MEN stack (MongoDb, Mongoose, Express, and NodeJS). It's purpose was simple: Make an application that can take some of my all time favorite memes and make them into my own! Soon to come is the ability to upload photos, and export photos.</p>
